# Core concept - FP & OOP

Functional programming and Object oriented programming are two methodologies which are not always fit as single approach.  
Some of the time the structure and the limits of object oriented design is the right approach for us, this methodology fits cases when we thinking about "what is" the data.

On other cases the flexibility of functional programming gives us the ability to perform procedure with minimum code line, the is most of the easier to maintain, this methodology fits cases when we thinking about "how" to handle the data.

SugoiJS designed to give us the developers the option to choose what we need and when we need it.   
SugoiJS provides fully decorator coverage for most of the boilerplate code and common actions along with preserving the ability to use those methods in the standard functional way.

So we will be able to use exactly what we want whenever we want it.
